# aspdotnut.io repo

This is the repo for my personal site, set to public to allow for the viewing of the very hard work of my braincells.

### How to run locally

If you for some reason want to locally run my site (you creep) you can do either of the following:
```bash
# run this for the ability to edit the files in real-time (needs bun installed)
bun dev

# run this if you just want to see it locally and don't want to install bun (recommended)
docker compose up -d
```
